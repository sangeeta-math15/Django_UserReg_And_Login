# Django Fundoo Note App 

- Developed Fundoo Notes APP backend using Django.
- we focused on the CRUD applications of Note.
- To give the app a start, run the below command in the Terminal / CMD:
django-admin startapp notes 
- django-admin startapp notes
This will create a new empty Django web-app that will have files inside ‘notes’ directory in our ‘myproject’ folder. This web-app can be integrated with our main Django project by including the app name in INSTALLED_APPS.
